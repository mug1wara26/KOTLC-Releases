Download builds from releases, make issues to report bugs or feature requests. Source code is in a private repo, releases are just automatically uploaded here using GitHub Actions

Note that Web builds have not been thoroughly tested.
The Web build is also being hosted [here](https://mug1wara26.itch.io/knights-of-the-lambda-calculus)
