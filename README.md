# Knights of the Lambda Calculus
Knights of the Lambda Calculus (KOTLC) is an offline, free-to-play, puzzle game built for Windows and Linux on x86-64 and arm64 systems. We have also released a Web build hosted on itch.io, but it has not been tested thoroughly as we focused development on the desktop app.
It was developed using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine over the span of 2 months as part of a university project.

The goal of this game is to teach players how Lambda Calculus works, by guiding players to construct expressions that express computations within the Lambda Calculus. At the end of the game, we hope that players can get a sense of how such a simple system can be powerful enough to compute anything a normal computer can.

The target audience of our game is anyone who is interested in Lambda Calculus, be it a beginner who has no experience programming, or a seasoned programmer who is curious about this topic, or even someone deeply familiar with Lambda Calculus but want to explore it more in a visual and interactive manner.
